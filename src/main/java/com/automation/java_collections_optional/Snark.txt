THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK

"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
   As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
   By a finger entwined in his hair.

"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
   That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
   What I tell you three times is true."

The crew was complete: it included a Boots -
   A maker of Bonnets and Hoods - 
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes -
   And a Broker, to value their goods.
